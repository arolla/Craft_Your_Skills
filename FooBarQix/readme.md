# FooBarQix #

Hello,
Welcome in our brand new startup where everything has to be done !

"Week 1" :
We just got some cash to implement a big part of our first feature.
We need you to implement a service (we will let aside the Rest/web service side of it).
It will take a number (positive integer) and provide :
- "Foo" if this number is multiple of 3
- "Bar" if this number is multiple of 5

If number have several multiples, they appear in natural order (Foo, Bar).

We will return the given number as a string if there is no transformation to do.

Once this step is complete, on can read and do ["Week 2"](./readme_then.md).
