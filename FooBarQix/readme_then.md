Here is "Week 2" :
You made it in time, thanks !
Clients have a good use of it, but are unhappy as Qix is missing !
In the rush we forgot to give you **a last rule in bold**.

It will take a number (positive integer) and provide :
- "Foo" if this number is multiple of 3
- "Bar" if this number is multiple of 5
- **"Qix" if this number is multiple of 7**

If number have several multiples, they appear in natural order (Foo, Bar, Qix).

We will return the given number as a string if there is no transfomration to do.

Easy rigth !
Hum.
Rigth ?
Hum, hum.

Now we are making money with satisfied customers !
As with all successfull software, people use it and trust you to them more with it !
Did you notice, the more sucessfull a software is, the more evolutions it has to implement ?
We do as TDD helps deploying "almost bug free" softwares by implementing the features right.
*Note that BDD helps us to implement the right feature !*

Let's go to next week, the [week 3](./readme_also.md), where real problems begins.
